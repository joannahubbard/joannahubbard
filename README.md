## Hi there 👋

- 🐦‍⬛ I’m currently working on:
    - documenting avian mortality due to window strikes on my campus
    - evaluating how feeder birds respond to different types of human disturbance
    - monitoring breeding eastern bluebirds and the ectoparasites that infest their nests
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how I can use GitHub to better organize and distribute lab materials for my courses.
